# -Workflow-Analysis-and-Insights-for-Data-Operations-
Project Overview:

Analyze sample data encountered by a Business Intelligence Analyst in the Data Operations Team.
Utilize Power BI to extract insights and provide useful information to help the Team Leader better understand the team's operations.
The Data Operations Team conducts online secondary research to gather relevant information about private companies.
Company information is stored in profiles identified by ProfileID, categorized as Private Equity (PE), Venture Capital (VC), Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A), etc.
Researchers work on multiple workflows within each profile, tracking time taken to complete workflows in seconds and benchmark points for added data.
Workflows are created by an automated system or other researchers based on company details like fundraising, industry group changes, etc.
Workflows are categorized based on the tracked information, such as New Company, New Round, etc., indicating the type of data being added.
Workflows are tagged with process types like news, client requests, product demos, and regions (Greater China, Europe) from where data is gathered.
Workflows go through various stages from creation to closure, with some workflows being unassigned if created with incorrect details.
The project aims to provide insights into workflow patterns, data sources, team performance, and areas of improvement for better team understanding and decision-making.
